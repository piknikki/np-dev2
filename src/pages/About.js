                        who loves to create fun, beautiful, and useful web applications (and I believe passionately in
                        the Oxford Comma).  ((and donuts))</h1>

                        full stack developer at a company where I can learn, grow, and continue to master the craft.
                        So far, I have used the following: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, React,
                        Mongo/Mongoose, MySQL, Sequelize, Handlebars, EJS, and a handful of other random
                        packages/libraries/etc.</h2>

                        with code. I'm implementing the languages that I'm learning as I go. My next step is to learn
                        an iOS and Android language like Flutter and learn how to convert my SPAs to PWAs.</h3>
